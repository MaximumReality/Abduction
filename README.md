## 🧠 About This Project

Abduction started as a simple experiment:
- No engine
- No frameworks
- Just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

It later became the foundation for the **Maximum Reality Arcade**, which now hosts multiple games across separate repositories.

If you encounter a missing page or broken link, the game’s 404 redirects back to the arcade hub.
